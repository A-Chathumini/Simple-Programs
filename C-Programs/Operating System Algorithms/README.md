# Algorithms Related to Operating System
This folder contains C programs that implement various algorithms related to Operating System. <br><br>
It contains popular scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Round Robin and Priority. <br><br>
Other classical process synchronization problems are also solved here using semaphores. <br>
Note: Use Linux environment to compile and run the Process Sycnhronization code since they use libraries such as pthread and semaphore that work only in Linux. You can use a VM or WSL if you do not have native Linux.<br><br>
Memory Allocation algorithms such as best fit, first fit and worst fit are also included.
